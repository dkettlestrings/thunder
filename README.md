A library for doing algebraic/geometric number theory for function fields over finite fields.

## What Does It Do?

Right now, not much.  The intention is for it to be a tool that allows mathematicians and students to generate examples, demonstrate theorems, and explore.

## How Do I Get It?

For right now, the only way to get it is to clone this repository and build it yourself (see below).  In the future, this library 
will be made available through more convenient means.

## Build

To build, simply execute

`sbt compile`

or if you're more paranoid, you can both compile and run tests

`sbt test`

## Dependencies

To build `thunder` you need the following:
* [sbt](http://www.scala-sbt.org/): version 0.13.8 or higher (older versions probably work, but have not been tested)
* [Scala](http://www.scala-lang.org/): version 2.11.7 or higher (older versions may work, but have not been tested)

## Contributing

Simply open a pull request and I'll get right on it.

The project is actively seeking suggestions for where to go next.
